## Conclusions

- Implemented a suite of open-source phase retrieval algorithms
  - Particular emphasis on robustness against experimental artifacts
  - New [preprint out now](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05250): 2309.05250
- Developed novel reconstruction algorithm &rarr; magnetic vector potential in 3D
  - Requires no prior-knowledge (e.g. sample periodicity)
  - Robust against low signal-to-noise datasets
  - Enables independent electrostatic/magnetic regularizations
- Demonstrated algorithm utility in simulated 3D 
  - Enables atomic-scale imaging of antiferromagnetic order

## Outlook

- Demonstrate technique experimentally &rarr; NiO and $\alpha \mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ crystals  
- Investigate resolution limits set by turning objective lens off (Lorentz STEM)
